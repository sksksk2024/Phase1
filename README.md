# ðŸŽ® Rock Paper Scissors â€“ Mastering the Basics  

**Mastering the basics is no easy feat!** At some point, you must fully understand the fundamentals before pushing beyond. 
As a first phase, I challenged myself to build this advanced project using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**â€”the core of web development.  

Iâ€™m proud of this decision because it strengthened my confidence, allowing me to transition smoothly into my broader stack: 
**MERN + Framer Motion + Next.js** (the last two are coming in the future).  

Now, take a deep breath, relax, and step into the world of my first game: **Rock Paper Scissors**â€”with an exciting **bonus mode** featuring **Lizard and Spock**!  

âš¡ **Have fun, and stay disciplined!**
